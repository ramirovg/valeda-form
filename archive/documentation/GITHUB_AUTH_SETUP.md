# GitHub Authentication Setup for Server

**Issue:** GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git operations.

## Quick Solution for Deployment

Since you only need to **clone** the repository for deployment, use the public HTTPS URL:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramirovg/valeda-form.git valeda
```

This works because your repository is public and doesn't require authentication for read access.

## Long-term Solutions

### Option 1: SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Generate SSH key on your server
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ramirovg@users.noreply.github.com"
```

**Step 2:** Display the public key
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Step 3:** Add to GitHub
1. Copy the entire key output
2. Go to [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Paste the key and give it a name like "DigitalOcean Server"
5. Save

**Step 4:** Test SSH connection
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**Step 5:** Clone using SSH
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ramirovg/valeda-form.git valeda
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token

**Step 1:** Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration (recommend 90 days)
4. Select scope: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Copy the generated token

**Step 2:** Use token as password
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramirovg/valeda-form.git valeda
# Username: ramirovg
# Password: [paste your personal access token]
```

**Step 3:** Store credentials (optional)
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If clone still asks for password:
```bash
# Try explicit HTTPS URL
git clone https://github.com/ramirovg/valeda-form.git valeda

# If it still asks, your repo might be private
# Use Personal Access Token method above
```

### If SSH key doesn't work:
```bash
# Check SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Test connection again
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### If you need to switch from HTTPS to SSH later:
```bash
cd valeda
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ramirovg/valeda-form.git
```

---

## For Deployment (Current Need)

**Just run this command on your server:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramirovg/valeda-form.git valeda
```

If it asks for authentication, your repository might be private. Let me know and we'll set up a Personal Access Token quickly.
